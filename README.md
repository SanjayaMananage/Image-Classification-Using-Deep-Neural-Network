# Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Neural-Network

Dataset
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards
and Technology dataset. This dataset contains a training set of 60,000 28Ã—28 grayscale
images of 10 handwritten digits (from 0 to 9), along with a test set of 10,000 images.
Objective
We build a convolutional deep neural network model to classify a given image of a handwritten
digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively. This is a
multiclass classification problem with 10 output classes.
Technique
We use convolutional deep learning neural network for image classification from scratch. For
fitting the model , we use ReLU activation for the hidden layers, softmax activation for the
output layer and tune other hyperparameters to optimality. We check performance of our
model using classification accuracy, confusion matrix and ROC curve.
Coding language
Python programming language is being used for this project. We use Python libraries for
data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and for model evaluation. Main method will be
coded from scratch.
